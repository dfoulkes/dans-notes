# Dans Dev Diary

This document is a collection of common scripts, processes and tools that I use to manage my computer estate and 
perform as a devops engineer both professionally and personally. 

It is a living document and will be updated as I find new tools and processes.

The aim of this document is:

  * To provide a reference for myself
  * To detailed guide for repeating technical tasks.
  * A place to store acquired knowledge.
